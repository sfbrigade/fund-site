              <h4>Help us Build our Fundraising Database</h4>
              <p>
                We’d like to make this fundraising thing easier for our
                members. If we can build up our understanding of what local
                companies can do to support volunteer programs like our weekly
                Civic Hack Night, then we can figure out how to reduce the
                burden on our brigade members for securing matching donation
                and the volunteer grant process!
              </p>

                Do you know of any organizations that share our passion and
                values and could make a great Code for SFpartner? But, you
                don’t have time to talk to them about our organization? We can
                help you!
              </p>
